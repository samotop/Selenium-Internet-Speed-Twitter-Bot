# Selenium Internet Speed Twitter Bot

## Overview
This Python script, implemented in Selenium, monitors your internet speed using the Speedtest website and notifies your internet service provider on Twitter if the actual speed falls below the promised values.

## Prerequisites
Before using the script, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed on your machine.
- Selenium installed. You can install it using the following command: pip install selenium
- Chrome browser installed on your machine.

## Configuration
1. Replace the placeholder values in the `main.py` script with your actual information.

## Usage
1. Run the script using the following command: python main.py
2. The script will open the Speedtest website, measure your current internet speed, and print the results.
3. If the actual speed is below the promised values, the script will automatically tweet to your internet provider to notify them.

## Notes
- Ensure that your Twitter credentials are kept secure. Do not share them publicly.
- Use this script responsibly and in compliance with Speedtest and Twitter's terms of service.
